# Phishing-URL-AI-ML-PROJECT



## Description
This project aims to detect phishing URLs using AI and ML techniques. The model leverages feature engineering and machine learning algorithms to classify URLs as either legitimate or phishing.

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook PROJECT_AIML_PHISING_URL.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions inside the notebook to train and evaluate the model.

## Dataset
The dataset contains URL features extracted from various sources, labeled as phishing or legitimate. It includes:
- URL length
- Presence of special characters
- Use of IP addresses
- Domain age, and more.

## Model Details
- Feature extraction: Domain-based, URL-based, and lexical features.
- Machine Learning Algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
 
- Evaluation Metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score

## Results
The model achieves a high accuracy in detecting phishing URLs. Performance metrics and visualizations are provided in the notebook.

## Future Improvements
- Integrate deep learning models.
- Use real-time URL analysis.
- Improve feature selection techniques.
